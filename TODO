+ skipping 1 byte (not bytes)
+ better handling of bit reservoir when skipping (and with tags in middle)
+ different format for header changes (at least if !OUT_HEAD1ST)
- recognize frame before id3v1 at end of file as last (len == -1)
- doku
- VBR: check frames and bytes against actual values, warn about tags in middle
- VBR: check toc against frame positions in stream
- frame data length and crc for layer 2
- validity check on main data
- check integrity of tags
- check devaition from bitstream rate
- compute length in MSF correctly if sample rate changes
- statistics
	min/av/max: bitrate, samprate
	count: frames (good/bad), skiped bytes
F fix mp3

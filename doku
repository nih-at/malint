* CRC error (calc:XXXX != file:YYYY)

the crc malint calculated for this frame (XXXX) differs from the crc
stored in the stream (YYYY)

* frame data overflows frame (N > M)

the length of data in this frame (M, calculated from side-info or
bit-alloc) is more than the frame can contain (N).

* illegal header XXXXXXXX (AAAA)

XXXXXXXX (AAAA in ASCII) was found where a frame header was expected.



* MPEG V layer L ...

this stream is MPEG version V, audio layer L (other parameters from
frame haeder are printed also).  This is also output if header

* play time: HH:MM:SS (N frames)

play time of this stream is HH:MM:SS.  The stream contains N frames.

* play time: HH:MM:SS (according to vbr tag)

FAST INFO: according to the VBR tag, play time of this stream is HH:MM:SS.

* play time: HH:MM:SS (aproximately)

FAST INFO: based on the assumption that bit rate and sampling
frequency is constant throughout the stream, play time for this stream
is HH:MM:SS.

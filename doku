Things not working yet:

VBR only works if the VBR tag is at the beginning of the stream
(possibly after an ID3 tag) and spans to the end of the stream.

Large ID3v2 tags (>64k) or ID3v2 tags with unsynchronization are not
handled properly.

Layer 2 CRC calculation is not performed.



Error and warning messages:

* CRC error (calc:XXXX != file:YYYY)

the crc malint calculated for this frame (XXXX) differs from the crc
stored in the stream (YYYY)

* frame data overflows frame (N > M)

the length of data in this frame (M, calculated from side-info or
bit-alloc) is more than the frame can contain (N).

* illegal header XXXXXXXX (AAAA)

XXXXXXXX (AAAA in ASCII) was found where a frame header was expected.

* bit reservoir spans across ID3 tag

parts of the bit reservoir are located before an ID3 tag, whereas this
frame is located after it.

* main_data_begin overflows bit reservoir (N > R)

main_data_begin says this frame uses N bytes of the bit reservoir, but
the reservoir contains only R bytes.

* gap in bit stream (N < R)

only N of the R bytes in the bit reservoir are used.  This is not an
error.

* skipping N bytes

N bytes were skipped during resynchornization.

* skipping N bytes, reaching EOF

N bytes were skipped during resynchornization, thus reaching the end
of the stream.  Resynchornization failed.

* no sync found in 64k, bailing out

no sync was found while scanning 64k bytes.  Resynchronization was
given up.

* short [last] frame N of M bytes (D+P=M missing)

The [last] frame should be M bytes long, but was found to be only N
bytes long.  D bytes of frame data and P bytes of padding (giving M
bytes total) are missing.

* padding missing from [last] frame (P bytes)

All P bytes of padding was found to be missing from the [last] frame.

* padding missing from [last] frame (M of P bytes)

M of P bytes padding was found to be missing from the [last] frame.



Info messages:

* MPEG V layer L ...

this stream is MPEG version V, audio layer L (other parameters from
frame haeder are printed also).  This is also output if header
parameters change.

* play time: HH:MM:SS (N frames)

play time of this stream is HH:MM:SS.  The stream contains N frames.
(The play time calculation does not work if the sampling frequency is
not constant throughout the stream.)

* play time: HH:MM:SS (according to vbr tag)

FAST INFO: according to the VBR tag, play time of this stream is HH:MM:SS.

* play time: HH:MM:SS (aproximately)

FAST INFO: based on the assumption that bit rate and sampling
frequency is constant throughout the stream, play time for this stream
is HH:MM:SS.

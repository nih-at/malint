  This is malint, an MPEG Audio stream validator.

  It parses an MPEG audio stream and prints information about the
stream and format violations it finds.

  There is currently no documentation.  Many of the checks (and
information outputs) can be enabled or disabled via command line
switches.  Run `malint --help' for a list.

  `malint -I' (--fast-info) only prints information that can be
provided without reading (and parsing) the whole MPEG stream.

  For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'.

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site:
	ftp.giga.or.at /pub/nih/malint
	http://ftp.giga.or.at/pub/nih/malint
The latest version can always be found there.
